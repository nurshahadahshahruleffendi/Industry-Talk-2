# Industry Talk 2 📸

Date : 18 December 2025

I attended an industry talk by Ts. Hj. Abdul Alim Bin Abdul Talib. I learn the importance of planning project management and the relationship between academic knowledge and real-world industry practice. From this talk, I learn new knowledge, which is the comparison of SDLC approaches, which are waterfall and agile, and the role of AI as an assisting tool rather than a replacement for fundamental skills. This talk provides awareness of gaps between memorisation and true understanding and gave me the realisation of early preparation needed before entering industry. This talk makes me understand more deeply why project management is a core skill across all computing fields. The overall task reshaped my understanding of employability and reevaluated my insight that can be applied during university study.
